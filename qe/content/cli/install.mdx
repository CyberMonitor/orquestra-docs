description: The first step to using Orquestra
---


The first step to getting started with Orquestra is to install the `qe` CLI tool. 

Throughout the Orquestra documentation we'll stick to the long-form name of every command and flag. Once you've learned what the commands do, you may want to consult `qe -h` to learn the short forms.

## Before you begin

It is recommended to use a CLI version that is consistent with the Quantum Engine Server version. The `qe` command will warn you if it notices that your CLI version is out of sync with the server.
