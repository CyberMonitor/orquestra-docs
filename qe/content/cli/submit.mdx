To submit a workflow, please run the following command:

```Bash
qe submit workflow <path/to/workflow.yaml>
```

This will cause Quantum Engine to compile and run your workflow.

Please take note of the workflow ID, which will be printed out after a successful completion of the command above. You will need it to get your workflow results among other uses.
