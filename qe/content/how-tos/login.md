In order to start being productive with Orquestra, you need to log into the platform using the Quantum Engine CLI.

The Quantum Engine assumes that you have acquired the correct credentials from Zapata Computing. If you have not, please contact support. All you will need is your email in order to log in, which is done as follows:

```Bash
qe login -e <your-email-address> -s <quantum-engine-server-uri>
```

where the `quantum-engine-server-uri` will be provided to you upon your subscription.
