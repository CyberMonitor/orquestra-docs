Quantum Engine is Orquestra's component for controlling every step of workflow management. It allows you to submit your workflow as input, then handles assembling the code you want to run and scheduling and running the steps of your workflow. Then it seamlessly works in concert with Orquestra's [data management services](https://www.orquestra.io/docs/dcs/) to produce standardized results.
