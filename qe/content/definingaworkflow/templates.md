title: Templates 
description: blah blah blah
---

Workflow `templates` contain three sections:
- `inputs`: a declaration of expected `parameters` and `artifacts` needed when calling this template
- `outputs`: a declaration of expected `artifacts` produced by calling this template
- `steps`: a series of calls to other `templates`  

Workflow templates do not need to declare `inputs` or `outputs`, however, it
should be noted that without `inputs`, the steps **within** the template will only 
have access to artifacts created by previous steps **within the template** and 
workflow parameters, while when using a template without `outputs`, any steps 
**calling** this template will not have access to any artifacts produced inside 
the template

The basic outline for a workflow template is as follows:
```YAML
  - name: # template name
    inputs:
      parameters:
      # input parameter declarations
      artifacts:
      # input artifact declarations
    outputs:
      artifacts:
      # input artifact declarations
    steps:
      # A list of steps
      # to execute, either 
      # in parallel or
      # in sequence with each other
    
```

**Note:**
The difference between workflow templates and resource templates
is that, while [resource](https://orquestra.io/docs/qe/definingaworkflow/resources/) 
templates run source code on a physical machine, workflow templates define 
a series of steps to execute by calling other templates.

Every workflow must contain **at least** one `template`, the "entrypoint" template. This is where the Quantum Engine begins the execution of your workflow. 

As seen in the [Simulating Hâ‚‚ with VQE](https://www.orquestra.io/docs/tutorial/hydrogen-vqe/) 
tutorial, more complex workflows will often consist of workflow templates calling
other workflow templates. This allows for the expression of more complex workflows,
even including recursion!
