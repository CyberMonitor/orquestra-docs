This tutorial walks you through the steps to create your first [Quantum Engine resource](link to reference docs about resources) and how to use that resource in a [workflow](link to reference docs about workflows).
We can create a very minimalistic workflow without using resources but we will miss out on what makes workflows useful: sharing resusable [templates](link to reference docs about templates).

Our goal is have a resource that prints `Hello World` when used within a workflow. Therefore, our first goal is to create said resource.

## Resource

A resource is made of two components: the Python code that will be executed and the template that calls that Python code and reused within a workflow.

Since we only support Git resources right now, we're going to host our resource in a public Github repository.
It contains two folders:
1. The `src` folder contains your Python code. It must also contain a `setup.py` file that it is responsible for installing your code in the machine you've been given. This installation is done automatically for you.

1. The `template` folder contains your templates that use your Python code in the `src` folder.

Let's us elaborate a little more on those two folders.

### Python source

Your Python source can be anything you want it to be. The only requirement is that it is installable via `pip` using the `setup.py` file you provided. Here is a sample `setup.py`:

```Python

```

And as to the Python code itself, here it is:

```Python

```

### Template

Your template is responsible for invoking your Python source. An additional requirement that will make sense in most cases is that your template's parent must be `generic-task` which has the necessary instructions on where to run your Python code.


Please find below the `Hello World` template.

```YAML

```

With those two folders in place, we can now create a simple workflow that uses that resource.
Please find below a simple workflow that ends up printing the message onto standard output.
