## Overview

Resources are the building blocks for your workflows. They define what tasks you are able to perform and what data you will produce.

By incorporating source code into a _resource_, it becomes easily usable and shareable within Orquestra. Through the use of _resources_, we hope to make it as easy as possible to navigate the minefield of bringing your own source code into harmony with others'.  

## What is a resource? 

You can think of resources as the "libraries" available in your workflow. A resource is made of two components: 

1. The **source code** that will be executed at the runtime of a step inside an Orquestra workflow - this can contain one or more functions that take in input parameters and data and produce output data
2. The **template** that you can access in your workflow - it wraps your source code, making it "callable" from within your workflow

### Source Code

The *source code* for a resource is exactly that: it contains all the code to run the process you want. This code will typically be a set of functions that take in inputs and then produce output objects that can be serialized into [artifact(s)](https://www.orquestra.io/docs/dcs/data/artifacts/). 

###### Note: Currently, new resources must use Python 3.7 source code to be natively supported in Orquestra, however we will be expanding this support to other languages in the future.

### Resource Templates

*Resource Templates* are the wrappers around your source code that expose it to the wonderful world of Orquestra workflows. By taking a function and wrapping it into a template, it is able to be referenced in your workflow as a *task*.

A resource template definition contains:
1. The optional and necessary inputs, delineating between input parameters and input [*artifacts*](https://www.orquestra.io/docs/dcs/data/artifacts/)
2. The expected output *artifacts*
3. A short script that will call your source code

Resource templates are explained in detail on the [Templates page](https://www.orquestra.io/docs/qe/workflow/templates).

## How do I build my own resource?

### Structure

To be used by Orquestra, resources must contain two folders:
- A `src/` folder, containing your source code
- A `templates/` folder, containing the templates that can be called from within your workflow

An example of the full structure of a resource is below:

```bash
.
├── README.md
├── <font color="green"><b>src</b></font>
│   ├── README.md
│   ├── <font color="green"><b>python</b></font>
│   │   └── <font color="green"><b>orquestra</b></font>
│   │       ├── __init__.py
│   │       └── welcome.py
│   └── setup.py
└── <font color="green"><b>templates</b></font>
    └── hello.yaml
```

### Source Code Installation

Orquestra provides automatic installation of your source code. By configuring your resource with the structure outlined above, you will be able to reference your source code (marked by `welcome.py` in the above example) easily from within your template. The source code can be any valid python code.

#### Setup File

The setup file must be called `setup.py`. It is responsible for installing your code before being called by the template.

An example is shown below:

```Python
import setuptools

setuptools.setup(
    name                            = "orquestra",
    packages                        = setuptools.find_packages(where = "python"),
    package_dir                     = {
        "" : "python"
    },
    classifiers                     = (
        "Programming Language :: Python :: 3",
        "Operating System :: OS Independent",
    ),
)
```

For clarity, in this example: 
- `name` is the name of your package which you can reference in your template
- `packages` tells the installer to look for a subdirectory called `python` 
which contains your source code
- `package_dir` allows the contents of the `python` directory to be imported 
without the python path prefix, for example, with `from orquestra import all`

For more information regarding how to make your source code available as a `package`, please refer to the [setuptools documentation](https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setuptools.html#developer-s-guide).


#### Initialization File

The initialization file must be called `__init__.py`. An example is shown below:

```Python
from .welcome import welcome
```

Only the functions that are imported in this file will be accessible when using your source code as a package. Here you will want to import any functions that you need to call from the script in your template.

### Resource Templates

As mentioned above, your resource template is responsible for wrapping your source code into a callable object that can be referenced from within your workflow. Typically, there will be a one-to-one correspondence between the resource templates that you write and the functions from your source code that you want to expose to Orquestra.

All resource templates are expected to be in various files under the `templates` directory in a resource and must have the `.yaml` file extension. For these templates to be compiled, the file must begin with the `spec` and `templates` headers, with your templates defined below.

Templates are described in detail on the [Templates page](https://www.orquestra.io/docs/qe/workflow/templates).

Below is an example of a file containing a resource template named `welcome-to-orquestra` that calls the source code shown above.

```YAML
# Every template YAML file must begin with a `spec` and `templates`, without which your template won't compile.
spec:
  templates:

  # Definition for the "welcome-to-orquestra" template
  - name: welcome-to-orquestra
    parent: generic-task
    inputs:
      artifacts:
      - name: main-script
        path: /app/main.py  # The `path` value for artifacts is where they are placed and they must be under the `app` directory
        raw:
          data: |
            from orquestra import welcome
            welcome()
      parameters:
      - name: command
        value: python3 main.py
    outputs:
      artifacts:
      - name: welcome
        path: /app/welcome.json
```

### Referencing a Resource in a Workflow

For a detailed explanataion of how to reference a resource from within a workflow, please refer to the "Resources" section in [Building a Workflow One Step at a Time](https://www.orquestra.io/docs/qe/definingaworkflow/workflows/#building-a-workflow-one-step-at-a-time).
