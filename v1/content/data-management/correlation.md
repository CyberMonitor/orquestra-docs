## Correlation

Correlation is one of the main two data management functions of Orquestra.

The function of correlation is to collect output [artifacts](../../data-management/workflow-artifacts/) from a workflow execution, create [task data objects](../../data-management/workflow-artifacts/), and persist both the artifacts and task data objects for subsequent processing.

When workflows finish running, their output artifacts are automatically correlated by Orquestra.
