## Introduction

This tutorial walks you through the steps to create your first Quantum Engine workflow. The key components used in a workflow are **templates** and **resources**.

### Templates

Templates are analogous to functions - they define the inputs they take in, the actions to be performed, and then the outputs they produce. Templates can be defined once and reused multiple times within a workflow. 

There are also two kinds of templates, **resource templates** and **workflow templates**. To understand more about both types as well as the similarities and differences between the two, refer to the [Templates page](https://www.orquestra.io/docs/qe/workflow/templates/).

### Resources

Resources are a way of making both templates and source code reusable and shareable. 

A resource is made of two components: the source code that will be executed and the template that calls that code. To learn more about what comprises a resource as well as how to build your own, please refer to the [Resources page](https://www.orquestra.io/docs/qe/workflow/resources/).

## Building your own workflow

Creating a workflow consists of 3 major steps:

1. Create one or more templates and associated source code (optional)

1. Make templates and code available as a resource (optional)

1. Incorporate the resource into a workflow

Note: Steps 1 and 2 are optional if you reuse existing resources.

This tutorial will demonstrate:
- How to build your own resource, which will allow you to use your own code in your workflow
- How to use an existing resource in your workflow

We could create a very minimalistic workflow without using resources, but we would miss out on what makes Quantum Engine powerful: sharing reusable templates and source code. We will start by showing you how to build your own resource.

Since we currently only support Git resources, the first step is:

**1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/), create an account if you don't have one, and create a public Github repository.**

This repository will be where you build your resource. [This GitHub repo](https://github.com/zapatacomputing/tutorial-0-welcome) can be used as a guide for what it should look like at the end of the following steps.

To be used by Orquestra, resources must contain two folders:
- The `src` folder will contain:
  - A setup file that is responsible for installing your code on Orquestra when your workflow is executed. This installation is done automatically for you.
  - Your source code. For python resources, we want this to be under a folder called `python`.
- The `templates` folder contains your templates that use your source code in the `src` folder.

___
The structure we want to have is shown in more detail on the [Resources page](https://www.orquestra.io/docs/qe/workflow/resources/).

___

We will start with the `src` folder. Your Python source can be anything you want it to be. The only requirement is that it is installable via `pip` using the `setup.py` file you provide. 

**2. Using either the GitHub UI or by cloning your repo and using the command line, add a `src` folder to the repository with the path `python/orquestra` and with a python module in it called `welcome.py`.**

Our goal in the first part of this tutorial is to create a resource that produces an [artifact](https://www.orquestra.io/docs/dcs/data/artifacts/) with the text `Welcome to Orquestra!` when used within a workflow. The contents of `welcome.py` that will achieve this are below:

```Python
"""
This module saves a welcome message.
"""

import json

def welcome():
    message = "Welcome to Orquestra!"

    message_dict = {}
    message_dict["message"] = message
    message_dict["schema"] = "message"

    with open("welcome.json",'w') as f:
        f.write(json.dumps(message_dict, indent=2)) # Write message to file as this will serve as output artifact
```

*Two important notes:*

- All artifacts must have a `schema` field. More details on artifacts are found on the [artifacts page](https://www.orquestra.io/docs/dcs/data/artifacts/).

- We create the file `welcome.json` because any output has to be saved in a file in order to be passed on to the next step or to be accessible for data analysis after the workflow has completed. We will see how to pass it on to another step later in this tutorial. 


**3. Add the sample `welcome.py` script above to your `welcome.py` file.**

This python package also needs an initialization file. It can be very simple:

```Python
from .welcome import *
```

**4. Add the sample initialization file to a file in `src/python/orquestra` called `__init__.py`**

Next, we need to create a `setup.py` file to install this source code. Here is a sample `setup.py`:

```Python
import setuptools

setuptools.setup(
    name                            = "orquestra",
    packages                        = setuptools.find_packages(where = "python"),
    package_dir                     = {
        "" : "python"
    },
    classifiers                     = (
        "Programming Language :: Python :: 3",
        "Operating System :: OS Independent",
    ),
)
```

For clarity, in this example: 
- `name` is the name of your package which you can reference in your template
- `packages` tells the installer to look for a subdirectory called `python` 
which contains your source code
- `package_dir` allows the contents of the `python` directory to be imported 
without the python path prefix, for example, with `from orquestra import all`

For more information regarding how to make your source code available as a `package`, please refer to the [setuptools documentation](https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setuptools.html#developer-s-guide).

**5. Add the sample `setup.py` file text above to the `setup.py` file in your repository `src` folder.**

**6. Create the `templates` folder in the top level of your repository with a file called `welcome.yaml` inside of it.**
 
Let's elaborate on what the contents of the `templates` folder will be.

**Template**

Your resource template is responsible for invoking your Python source. A resource template that will call the Python source code we just wrote is below:

```YAML
# Every template YAML file must begin with a `spec`, without which your template won't compile.
spec:

  # The `templates` section is where you list one or more templates
  templates:

  # This is the name of the template, which is used to reference it in the workflow. This field is required.
  - name: welcome-to-orquestra

    # `generic-task` is the supertemplate that all templates (that don't contain a `steps` section) must inherit from
    parent: generic-task

    # This section is for the inputs needed to run the template. This section is required.
    inputs:

      # `parameters` represent initialization values for a template. 
      parameters:

      # The `command` parameter is required because that is what is run by `generic-task`.
      - name: command
        value: python3 main.py

      # This section creates a script called `main.py` containing the code below under `data`. It must be under the `app` directory in order for the command above to locate it.
      artifacts:
      - name: main-script
        path: /app/main.py
        raw:
          data: |
            from orquestra import welcome
            welcome()

    # This section is where output artifacts are listed. They must be listed here, or else they will get deleted when the template completes. They must be under the `app` directory in order to be saved.
    outputs:
      artifacts:
      - name: welcome
        path: /app/welcome.json
```

Please refer to the [Templates page](https://www.orquestra.io/docs/qe/workflow/templates/) for a more in-depth explanation of each of the fields in the above resource template.


**7. Add the sample `welcome.yaml` template snippet above to your `welcome.yaml` file.**

With those two folders in place, we can now create a workflow that uses our new resource. A sample workflow that will run the template we just created is below.

```YAML
# Workflow API version
ZapOSApiVersion: v1alpha1

# Declares this as workflow
kind: Workflow

# List resources needed by workflow.
resources:

# A resource named `welcome` that is a public git repo. All the fields here are required except branch, which defaults to master.
- name: welcome
  type: git
  parameters:
    url: "git@github.com:<your-github-username>/<your-git-repo-name>.git"
    branch: "master"

# Data to help you easily work with your workflow
metadata:

  # Prefix for workflow ID
  generateName: welcome-to-orquestra-

# Data for running the workflow
spec:

  # Think of this as identifying the `main` function -- this tells the workflow which template to start with
  entrypoint: salutations

  # Initializing global variables for use in workflow
  arguments:
    parameters:

    # Where output data is stored -- Must be `quantum-engine` for compatibility with Orquestra data services
    - s3-bucket: quantum-engine
    # Path where output data is stored within the `s3-bucket` -- can be anything you want
    - s3-key: tutorials/welcome/

  # The steps of the workflow
  templates:

  # `salutations` is a template that just contains a list of `steps`, which are other templates
  - name: salutations
    steps:

    # This template runs the `welcome-to-orquestra` template in the `welcome` resource
    - - name: greeting
        template: welcome-to-orquestra
        arguments:
          parameters:
          - resources: [welcome]
```
___
**Note**: Do not forget to update the resource url - `"git@github.com:<your-github-username>/<your-git-repo-name>.git"` - with the location of your resource.

___

Please refer to the [Workflow Basics page](https://www.orquestra.io/docs/qe/workflow/workflows/) for a more in-depth explanation of each of the fields in the sample workflow above.


**8. Create a file locally called `welcome-workflow.yaml` and put the above example workflow in it.**

Next, we will see how to use a pre-existing resource and explore one possible pattern for a workflow with multiple steps.

For example, Zapata has a resource with a URL of `git@github.com:zapatacomputing/tutorial-0-ztransform.git`. This will transform a message you give it in a fun way.

**9. Add another resource to the `resources` section of your workflow for this resource, using the `master` branch.**

After that, the resources section should look like the following:

```YAML
# List resources needed by workflow.
resources:

# A resource named `welcome` that is a public git repo. All the fields here are required except branch, which defaults to master.
- name: welcome
  type: git
  parameters:
    url: "git@github.com:<your-github-username>/<your-git-repo-name>.git"
    branch: "master"
    
- name: ztransform
  type: git
  parameters:
    url: "git@github.com:zapatacomputing/tutorial-0-ztransform.git"
    branch: "master"
```

This pre-built resource has a resource template called `z-transformation` along with the associated source code. By putting this resource in your workflow, you can now reference the `z-transformation` resource template. 

The following is the `templates` section of `welcome-workflow.yaml` with the new step added:
```YAML
  # The steps of the workflow
  templates:

  # `salutations` is a template that just contains a list of `steps`, which are other templates
  - name: salutations
    steps:

    # This template runs the `welcome-to-orquestra` template in the `welcome` resource
    - - name: greeting
        template: welcome-to-orquestra
        arguments:
          parameters:
          - resources: [welcome]

    # This template runs the `z-transformation` template in the `ztransform` resource
    - - name: transform-welcome
        template: z-transformation
        arguments:
          parameters:
          - resources: [ztransform]
          artifacts:
          - name: message
            # This template takes in the output artifact from the `welcome` template. 
            from: '{{steps.greeting.outputs.artifacts.welcome}}'
```

There is now a second step with the name `transform-welcome`. This step uses the resource template `z-transformation` from the  resource you just added. The template `z-transformation` takes in an artifact as input. To understand how the `welcome` artifact is passed from the `greeting` step to the `transform-welcome` step, check out the "Referencing Step Outputs" section of the [Steps page](https://www.orquestra.io/docs/qe/workflow/steps/).

**10. Edit the `templates` section of `welcome-workflow.yaml` to match the example above.**

Now you are ready to run the workflow!

**11. Make sure you have installed the Quantum Engine CLI by following the instructions [here](https://www.orquestra.io/docs/qe/cli/install/).**

**12. Log in to Quantum Engine by running `qe login -e <your-email> -s <quantum-engine-uri>` in your command line. Contact support to register your email and/or receive the `quantum-engine-uri`.**

**13. Submit your `welcome-workflow.yaml` by running `qe submit workflow <path/to/workflow/welcome-workflow.yaml>`**

This will return the workflow ID that corresponds to that particular execution of your workflow. The output will look like:
```Bash
Successfully submitted workflow to quantum engine!
Workflow ID: welcome-to-orquestra-d9djf
```

**14. To see details of the execution of your workflow, run `qe get workflow <workflow-ID>` with your workflow ID from the previous step substituted in.**

 The output will look like:
```Bash
Name:                welcome-to-orquestra-d9djf
Namespace:           default
ServiceAccount:      default
Status:              Succeeded
Created:             Thu Mar 19 21:14:33 +0000 (5 minutes ago)
Started:             Thu Mar 19 21:14:33 +0000 (5 minutes ago)
Finished:            Thu Mar 19 21:19:49 +0000 (19 seconds ago)
Duration:            5 minutes 16 seconds
Parameters:
  s3-bucket:         quantum-engine
  s3-key:            tutorials/welcome/

STEP                                         STEPNAME                                DURATION  MESSAGE
 ✔ welcome-to-orquestra-d9djf (salutations)
 ├---✔ greeting (welcome-to-orquestra)       welcome-to-orquestra-d9djf-2235995037  5m
 └---✔ transform-welcome (z-transformation)  welcome-to-orquestra-d9djf-1289017430  13s
```

This output shows the status of the execution of the steps in your workflow.

**15. To get the results of your workflow, run `qe get workflowresult <workflow-ID>` with your workflow ID.**

After a workflow runs, it takes time for the data to be processed. This results file cannot be created until the data is done being processed. You can try running the above command every few minutes until it returns a link to download a file. 

Once finished, the output will look like the following:
```Bash
Name:        welcome-to-orquestra-d9djf
Location:    http://40.89.251.200:9000/workflow-results/bb2b58b4-b25d-59e3-9fee-e7b79f0c20d5.json?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=zapata%2F20200319%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20200319T212017Z&X-Amz-Expires=604800&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&response-content-disposition=attachment%3B%20filename%3D%22bb2b58b4-b25d-59e3-9fee-e7b79f0c20d5.json%22&X-Amz-Signature=c4de1784b252fa6164aea8aa49a91bdd84c20c4dc55411e93f69a57b4ea62ac1

        }
    }
}
```

The sections `welcome-to-orquestra-d9djf-1289017430` and `welcome-to-orquestra-d9djf-2235995037` correspond to the steps that were run by your workflow. Note that these IDs match those in the output of `qe get workflow`. Each of these sections contains information about the template that was executed for the given step, any input parameters or input artifacts, and the output artifacts. The artifact `welcome` is the output of the `greeting` template, and the artifact `zessage` is the output of the `transform-welcome` template. More information on the contents of this file are found on the [Workflow Results via JSON page](https://www.orquestra.io/docs/dcs/data/json/).

**Note:** The sections in this results file will not necessarily be in the order that they were executed.

## Summary

We have now seen how to construct a working workflow from its elemental components: templates and resources.
Additionally, we submitted a workflow to Quantum Engine and got its result in JSON format.
This hopefully introduced some of the key concepts and mechanics in using Orquestra Quantum Engine.
