## Introduction

This tutorial will walk through an implementation of a predicting model using *Recurrent Neural Networks*. A recurrent neural network deals with sequence problems as they can retain state from one iteration to the next by using their own output as input for the next step, i.e. in a recurrent neural network, you not only give the network the data, but also the state of the network one moment before. A simple recurrent network suffers from a fundamental problem of not being able to capture long-term dependencies in a sequence. In late â€™90s, *LSTM* was proposed by **Sepp Hochreiter** and **Jurgen Schmidhuber** [https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/neco.1997.9.8.1735]
